## Installing Locally
To run the application locally, we need to install a few dependences:

- NodeJs
- Angular CLI
- NestJs CLI
- Docker
- Nginx
- MonogoDB
- InfluxDB

I'll walk through how I install them. Big fan of [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle). However, please feel free to install them how you would like.
